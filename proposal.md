## **Updated Project Proposal: Detecting Echo Chambers and Bias in AI-Powered Learning Communities**

### **1. Introduction**  
AI-driven educational platforms personalize learning by recommending content based on students' interests and progress. However, such personalization can inadvertently create echo chambers where students only encounter similar perspectives, reinforcing biases. This project examines how cooperation and competition emerge in digital learning communities through AI recommendations. By modeling interactions as a knowledge graph, we will detect insular clusters and assess bias in content recommendations. This approach builds on decentralized, graph-based analysis methods, central to CMPE58A, to highlight both the collaborative and competitive aspects of digital information ecosystems .

### **2. Objectives**  
- **Graph-Based Modeling of Cooperation:** Represent students, educational resources, and discussion topics as nodes, with edges capturing interactions (e.g., content consumption, discussion participation, and AI recommendations).  
- **Detect Echo Chambers:** Apply community detection algorithms (Louvain, spectral clustering) to identify groups where interactions are narrowly focused.  
- **Assess AI Bias:** Quantitatively measure content diversity using Shannon entropy and evaluate centrality metrics (betweenness centrality, PageRank) to determine whether AI recommendations reinforce existing silos.  
- **Develop an Adaptive Recommender:** Design a system that adjusts content suggestions dynamically to introduce counterbalancing topics when an echo chamber is detected, thereby promoting a more diverse learning experience.

### **3. Methodology**

#### **A. Graph-Based Modeling and Data Preparation**  
- **Synthetic Data Generation:** Create a dataset that simulates interactions among students, educational resources (articles, videos, AI-generated explanations), and discussion topics.  
- **Graph Construction:**  
  - **Nodes:** Represent students, resources, and topics.  
  - **Edges:** Capture various interactions such as student-resource engagements and peer discussions, as well as the influence of AI-generated recommendations.  
- **Tools:** Utilize Neo4j for graph storage and Python libraries (e.g., Py2neo, NetworkX) for data manipulation and preliminary analysis.

#### **B. Network Analysis and Echo Chamber Detection**  
- **Community Detection:**  
  - Implement Louvain modularity and spectral clustering algorithms to segment the graph into communities.  
  - Use K-means clustering as a secondary approach to validate community boundaries.
- **Metric Computation:**  
  - **Diversity Measurement:** Compute Shannon entropy for each node to quantify the variety in content exposure.  
  - **Influence Identification:** Calculate betweenness centrality and PageRank to spot key nodes that could bridge isolated clusters.
- **Visualization:**  
  - Deploy Gephi to create interactive visual representations of the network, highlighting clusters and the overall cooperation/competition dynamics.

#### **C. AI Bias Analysis and Adaptive Recommendation**  
- **Bias Assessment:**  
  - Compare AI-generated content recommendations with the synthetic interaction data to identify over- and under-represented topics.  
  - Analyze topic recurrence patterns to assign a bias score to the AI recommendations.
- **Adaptive Recommender System:**  
  - Develop a mechanism that monitors diversity metrics in real time.  
  - When an echo chamber is detected, the system will adjust recommendations by incorporating counterbalancing topics determined via similarity scores and updated centrality metrics.
- **Integration:**  
  - Use Python for the integration of dynamic recommendation adjustments, leveraging libraries like NetworkX for periodic graph re-analysis.

### **4. Implementation Plan**

The project will be executed in clearly defined phases with a modular approach that ensures steady progress without overwhelming complexity:
